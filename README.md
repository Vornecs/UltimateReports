⭐ **Works Cross-Server**\
The plugin will synchronize all data real-time between proxied servers using MySQL and a message broker (check the config).

⭐ **Optimization**\
Written from scratch, the whole plugin is developed with optimization in mind.

⭐ **Discord Integration**\
You can choose to just send webhooks, or have a bot that lets you update and manage reports directly on Discord

⭐ **Dialogs**\
They just got added, and UltimateReports already supports them. If your server (and the player) are running a supported version, they will be able to perform certain actions in a Dialog

⭐ **GUI**\
Everything can be seen and managed in GUIs

⭐ **Customization**\
Every single message can be modified from the plugin's config

⭐ **PlaceholderAPI**\
Some placeholders are already available without requiring to download an external jar

⭐ **Punishments**\
If a player use the report system wrongfully, you can put them on cooldown
